# password-manger

by this application , we will be able to generate passwords and add it to our database of passwords butwe're also going to be able to search through that database. 
so we could type in the name of a website , hit search and it'll tell us whta the email and password is that we need to use to log into the website.
plus, we made this a lot safer by handling some of exceptions that could happen and make sure that in all circumstances our app will worl excatly as expected .
